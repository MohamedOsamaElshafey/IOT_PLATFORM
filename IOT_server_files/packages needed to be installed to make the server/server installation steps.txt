listener 1883
protocol mqtt
allow_anonymous true

# ===== MQTT over WebSockets (for Cloudflare)
listener 8083
protocol websockets
allow_anonymous true

*////////
4- make a service in the cloudflared http:// localhost:8083 and the dns is mqtt.casper-we.site
5-install the MQTT EXPLORER to test your mqtt 
   post man will not work 
because the mosquito server speaks MQTT over websocket protocol
but post man program speaks only websocket protocol so it wont work because the frames will not be the same
